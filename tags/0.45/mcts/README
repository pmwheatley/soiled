The MUD Client Test Server.

MCTS is a TCP server that can be used to develop/test telnet/mud clients.
It is quite simple, but it has enough commands to test most features of
a client with ease.


Compile the code with "make" and then run the "mcts" binary. It takes
an optional argument, the port it should bind to, the default is 5445.

Connect to the port with a telnet/mud client. Send "help" to get
a list of understood commands.
