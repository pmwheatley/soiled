    <title>Soiled's features</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Soiled's current features are:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
  Uses the TELNET protocol.  Understands ECHO, ENDOFRECORD, SUPRESS GO AHEAD, TERMINAL TYPE and NAWS TELNET options, answers DONT/WONT on other options.
    </li>
    <li>
  Understands LF and CR like they are supposed to work.
    </li>
    <li>
    Has local line editing using the emacs key bindings
    (CTRL-A, B, D, E, F, K, L, U and W).
    </li>
    <li>
  Sends cursor keys, F1-F12, PGUP, PGDN, HOME and END to the server.
  Cursor keys can be sent in both application and "normal" mode.
    </li>
    <li>
    Supports the following VT100/VT102 control functions:
    SM, RM, DECSET, DECRST, DECSTBM, CUU, CUD, CUF, CUB, CUP, HVP, IND, RI, NEL,
    DECSC, DECRC, DECPAM, DECKPNM, SCS, SGR, HTS, TBC, EL, ED, DCH, IL, DL, DA,
    DECID, RI and RIS. DECOM, IRM, LNM.
    </li>
    <li>
  Understands xterm's 256 colour sequences.
    </li>
    <li>
	char-by-char mode, sort off... When local echo is turned off, it operates in char-by-char mode.
    </li>
    <li>
  Works as a client to most MUD servers and one can play nethack with DECGraphics via it. :-)
    </li>
    <li>
  Basic scrollback buffer. Use shift + PGUP/PGDN to look at previous output.
    </li>
    <li>
        Copy & Paste.
    </li>
    <li>
	Aliases/macros.  There is basic support for aliases & macros, but nothing fancy yet.
	Internal commands can be viewed with: /help
    </li>
</ul>

<h2> Planned features (no order and may change)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
	ctrl-r/ctrl-s (search in input history).
    </li>
    <li>
	Improved scrollbuffer (including copy)..
    </li>
    <li>
	MXP? The protocol is badly specified with ambiguities, it badly makes
	use of existing clients/servers existing features and is more complicated
	than needed in my opinion. Its no wonder that so few clients support it.
    </li>
    <li>
	Word wrapping? I consider that a server feature since it is impossible
	for the client to format multi-column text, tables and ascii art
	correctly. On the other hand there are many muds that can't do this...
    </li>
    <li>
	triggers? There's something wrong with the gameplay if the player
	should have to write triggers. Improve the gameplay instead (or make
	the triggers a part of the server).
    </li>
</ul>
