#summary Release Note for version 0.43
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

Version 0.43 only contains a few, minor changes. It is now stable enough to play and view games at http://nethack.alt.org/

= Detailed changelist =

  * Added support for Reverse Index (RI).
  * Changed the HOME and END keys to work like xterm.

= The changes in version 0.42 =

  * Change the order of the terminal names; put xterm-color first, to make it easy to use the client against public NetHack servers (and other telnetd based services).
  * Changed BACKSPACE and DELETE keys to be like VT220 (and linux console, OS X Terminal) when not in local edit mode; BS sends DEL (127), DEL sends CSI 3 tilde
  * Fixed incorrect escaping of IAC, causing 127 to be escaped instead of 255...
  * Made the initial setting of LOCAL_EDIT be settable from the flash-parameters.
  * Made LOCAL_EDIT be off if in char-by-char mode.
  * Added support for one byte CSI and OSC characters (and they work with UTF-8 too).
  * Implemented the Q-method of TELNET option negotiation to add some extra protection against option-looping when dealing with servers that don't implement the protocol correctly.
  * Optimised pasting some.
  * (Refactored the code some and split it into more classes).
