#summary The list of things to do.

= Features that would be good to support =

  * autowrap support.
  * xterm:ish mouse tracking.
  * Support copy & scrollback at the same time. Be able to select more than a screen of text.
  * Re-add support for double clicking when selecting and make it better (like xterm)

  * Pass all tests for the vttest program...

= Features that would be good when using Soiled as a mud client =

  * Use a split screen when scrolling back, so one always sees the bottom of the screen. That is good for muds.
  * CTRL-R/S to search the command line history. Should work like readline.
  * Word wrapping in the client (must be setable). Lesser muds need this...
  * Expand variables in aliases/macros.
  * Set variables from regexps matching received text (limited triggers).
